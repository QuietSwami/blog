Normally, there is no reason to publish drafts. I mean, who wants to display to the world their unfinished, unpolished and unverfied work? Aparently me. The idea was borned after I read [Learning in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) by Shawn Wang. The premise is simple: while the majority of us learn in private, learning by publicaly displaying what you know about a subject, and submitting yourself to the wider public critisism has the ability of actually improving how *deep* you learn. Because there's always someone out there who knows more than you.

I decided to apply the same reason to my drafts. Once I started my PhD, I've noticed that I write supremely badly. Better yet, I tend to drive straight to the point, to a point only understandable by me. I lack a talent in explaining things, or at least explaining myself. After noticing that this would pose a problem later on in my PhD, I decided to create this blog, and share with the anyone who has any interest in any of the subjects I'll discuss, what I'm doing trying to explain it in more detail. The second point is that I will use this website like a notebook, as a method to further extend my knowledge. Therefore, the idea to publish drafts is to invite (constructive) criticism from anyone who might know more than me, or from those who wish to learn about the subjects that I'm wrtting and aren't undestanding much.

So, if you wish to form a (polite) complaint about any of my posts, please do not hesitate to write to my [email](francisco.abmendonca@gmail.com)
