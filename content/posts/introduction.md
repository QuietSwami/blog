After one year in my PhD, I accumulated a lot of notes, both hand-written or written using tools like Obsidian, Notion, or similar. I've loss track of most notes I took, and do not actively keep track of most. I thought a blog was exactly what I needed, somewhere to discuss more in depth some of the work I'm developing, and other projects I come across.

I hope this blog comes to serve some use to at least me - a place where I can develop further certain ideas, skills, and other tid bits I might find interesting.

If you want to follow what I'm working on, there always my [GitHub](https://github.com/QuietSwami).
