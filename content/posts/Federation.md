For the past few weeks I've been interested in exploring how [data cooperatives]({{< ref "Data_Cooperatives.md" >}}) can be extended by forming a Federation. And how these federations can be organized. Later, I'll present in more detail what type of architecture I propose to implement this, but for now, let's have a look on the idea of Federation of Data Cooperatives 

Just to give you a quick introduction, data cooperatives are groups of data producers under a common interest, who voluntarly pool their data under a common organization. This mainly benefits people or organizations who, otherwise, wouldn't be able to sustain such a infrastructure on their own. The cooperative is created, owned, and managed by the community members, enabling the member to have full control on their data. Decision, for example, who can access and how the access is made, is taken by the members of the cooperative. 

While data cooperatives could be very helpful, the main disadvantege is the lack of scope. A data cooperative aggregates data from producers under a specific industry. Let's take the case of agriculture. A data cooperative can be created by farmers that produce a specific crop, in order to pool their data together under a common goal. While this cooperative can be used by the farmers themselves, the data produced has little value besides to the farming operations. To extend the value of the data the farmers produce, data from other agricultural stakeholders might be required. 

A federation is a union of partially self-governing organizations under a common goal. We see federation in our daily life. We know that, for example, that states like Russia, United States, and Australia and others are federations, which means that the states that compose the country are autonumous to a certain degree. This degree depends on the country, but, in general, each state that composes the federation has a saying in the decisions of the country.
